# OmniGBDT

OmniGBDT packages the original [GBDT-MO](https://github.com/zzd1992/GBDTMO) algorithm as a regular Python library. The native C++ training core remains in place, while the Python layer adds wheel-based installation, public custom-objective hooks, optional sklearn-compatible wrappers, and accuracy-oriented regression defaults.

The main public classes are `MultiOutputGBDT` and `SingleOutputGBDT`.

## Why OmniGBDT

- Joint multi-output gradient boosting from the original GBDT-MO research codebase
- Standard `pip` and `uv` installation with the native library bundled inside the package
- Public Python callbacks for custom gradients, Hessians, metrics, and early stopping
- Optional sklearn-compatible wrappers for tools such as permutation importance
- Accuracy-oriented regression defaults in the current fork: `num_rounds=200`, `lr=0.05`, `max_bins=128`, `early_stop=15`, and automatic mean initialization when `base_score` is unset

- Experiment and evaluation repository: <https://github.com/zzd1992/GBDTMO-EX>

## Installation

Install the released package:

```bash
pip install omnigbdt
```

or with `uv`:

```bash
uv add omnigbdt
```

Optional extras:

```bash
pip install "omnigbdt[plot]"
pip install "omnigbdt[sklearn]"
```

The current wheel targets are:

- Linux x86_64
- Windows x86_64
- macOS arm64 (Apple Silicon, 14+)

## First Model

The example below trains one `MultiOutputGBDT` model on two correlated targets using only NumPy:

```python
import numpy as np

from omnigbdt import MultiOutputGBDT, Verbosity

rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
X = rng.normal(size=(400, 6))
shared_signal = 1.2 * X[:, 0] - 0.8 * X[:, 1] + 0.5 * X[:, 2] * X[:, 3]
Y = np.column_stack(
    [
        shared_signal + 0.3 * X[:, 4],
        shared_signal - 0.2 * X[:, 5],
    ]
)

X_train, Y_train = X[:240], Y[:240]
X_valid, Y_valid = X[240:320], Y[240:320]
X_test = X[320:]

model = MultiOutputGBDT(
    out_dim=Y.shape[1],
    params={
        "loss": b"mse",
        "max_depth": 4,
        "max_bins": 128,
        "lr": 0.05,
        "early_stop": 15,
        "num_threads": 1,
        "verbosity": Verbosity.SILENT,
    },
)
model.set_data((X_train, Y_train), (X_valid, Y_valid))
model.train(200)

preds = model.predict(X_test)
print(preds.shape)
```

`SingleOutputGBDT` can be used to train one model per target column as a simple baseline. A real-world financial benchmark based on the UCI Stock Portfolio Performance dataset, together with custom-objective and sklearn examples, is available in the hosted docs and in [docs/example.rst](docs/example.rst).

## Differences From The Original Package

Compared with the upstream GBDT-MO repository, OmniGBDT currently adds:

- standard Python packaging and bundled native-library loading
- wheel automation for Linux, macOS, and Windows
- public Python callback hooks for custom gradients, Hessians, metrics, and early stopping
- optional sklearn-compatible wrappers
- automatic regression mean initialization when `base_score` is omitted
- scalar or per-output `base_score` values for `MultiOutputGBDT`
- accuracy-oriented wrapper defaults for regression workflows

Several targeted native-code fixes are also part of the fork, so same-seed runs are not guaranteed to match older buggy runs exactly. A fuller summary is available in [docs/differences.rst](docs/differences.rst).

## Project Provenance

This fork builds directly on the original GBDT-MO implementation by Zhendong Zhang and Cheolkon Jung.

OmniGBDT is intended to make the package easier to build, install, and distribute. It is not the canonical source for the paper, benchmark tables, figures, or research documentation.
